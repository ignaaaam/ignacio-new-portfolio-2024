# Open for New Clients Worldwide: Experienced Full Stack Web Developer

Hello everyone! I'm Ignacio Amat, a full stack web developer from Barcelona, with over 3+ years of experience in both back end and front end development. I'm excited to announce that I am now open to new clients worldwide and ready to take on new projects remotely. 

## My Expertise

### Back End Development
My highest skill is in back end development, specifically with PHP and the Laravel framework. I can help you build robust, scalable, and efficient applications from scratch or improve your existing Laravel applications. Whether it's a simple website or a complex web application, I have the expertise to deliver high-quality solutions.

### Front End Development
On the front end, I am proficient in JavaScript and Vue.js, and I utilize TailwindCSS for crafting beautiful and responsive user interfaces. I am also experienced with the TALL stack (Tailwind, AlpineJS, Laravel, Livewire) and the VILT stack (Vue, Inertia, Laravel, Tailwind), which allows me to develop modern, dynamic, and interactive web applications.

### Fast and Efficient Web Development
For fast, optimized, and efficient web development, I leverage the Astro framework to create high-performance websites and landing pages. Additionally, if you prefer a CMS-based solution, I can build and customize websites using WordPress.

- **Bug Fixes and Error Resolution**: Encountering issues with your website? I can quickly diagnose and fix bugs or errors.
- **Laravel Application Upgrades**: If your Laravel app needs an upgrade or new features, I have the experience to enhance your application effectively.
